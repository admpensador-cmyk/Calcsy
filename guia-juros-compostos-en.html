    <h1>Complete guide to compound interest</h1>
    <p>
      Compound interest is one of the most important concepts in finance. It is often called
      “interest on interest” because, unlike simple interest, the return from each period is
      reinvested and begins to earn interest itself. In practice, this means that your wealth
      grows exponentially over time. Understanding how compound interest works is essential for
      anyone who wants to invest efficiently.
    </p>
    <h2>What is compound interest?</h2>
    <p>
      Compound interest is a form of capitalization in which the amount generated at the end of
      each period is added to the principal and, in the next period, both amounts earn interest
      together. The general formula is \(M = P \times (1 + i)^n\), where \(M\) is the final
      amount, \(P\) is the principal (initial value), \(i\) is the rate per period (expressed as
      a decimal) and \(n\) is the number of periods. When there are periodic contributions, each
      contribution also grows over time because it is invested at the start of each period and
      will earn until the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power of compound interest is so important that Albert Einstein reportedly called it
      the “eighth wonder of the world”. Over the years, small amounts can turn into large sums.
      The longer the timeframe and the higher the rate, the more pronounced the effect.
    </p>
    <h2>How to use Calcsy’s calculator</h2>
    <p>
      The Calcsy compound interest calculator helps you model different scenarios without having
      to memorize formulas. To use it, fill in the following fields:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Initial amount:</strong> the amount you already have and want to invest immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly contribution:</strong> the amount you will deposit each month during the period (it can be zero if there are no contributions).</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly rate (%):</strong> the expected monthly return. Remember that very high rates can be unrealistic, so use parameters in line with the market.</li>
      <li><strong>Months:</strong> the time your money will remain invested. In fixed‑income investments, longer periods amplify the effect of compound interest.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After filling in the fields, click <em>Calculate</em>. The system will display the future
      value, the total contributed over time, and how much of that amount corresponds to the
      accumulated interest. If you want to see the evolution month by month, the calculator
      also shows a chart indicating the growth of the balance.
    </p>
    <h2>Practical example</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine investing $1,000 with a monthly contribution of $200 for 12 months at a rate of
      1 % per month. At the end of the period, the total will be higher than the sum of the
      amounts you invested because each time the interest is credited it joins the principal and
      earns interest again. At first, the difference between simple and compound interest seems
      small, but over time it becomes significant.
    </p>
    <p>
      This example shows that, even with relatively small contributions, compound interest helps
      you reach medium- and long‑term goals. The earlier you start investing, the larger the
      portion of your final amount will come from the interest. The regularity of your
      contributions also plays a fundamental role: when you skip a month you not only miss that
      contribution but also the interest it would have earned.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips and cautions</h2>
    <p>
      When simulating investments, take inflation and taxes into account. The result presented
      by the calculator is gross, that is, it does not deduct management fees or income tax
      where applicable. For a more complete view, compare investment products based on their
      net rate or find out about taxation (such as the regressive income tax table and the IOF
      tax on short‑term investments).
    </p>
    <p>
      Another pitfall is confusing nominal and effective rates. For example, an annual return
      of 12 % is not exactly the same as 1 % per month when compounding monthly. When
      converting rates, use specific tools (Calcsy provides an equivalent rate converter).
      Setting correct parameters prevents projections from straying too far from reality.
    </p>
    <h2>Common mistakes and frequently asked questions</h2>
    <p>
      Beginners often make a few mistakes when dealing with compound interest. One is to use
      very optimistic rates based on past returns that are not guaranteed. Another is forgetting
      that contributions must fit within your budget; there is no point in planning large
      monthly deposits if you cannot maintain them in practice. Finally, comparing investments
      without considering risk can lead to bad decisions—equities may have higher long‑term
      returns but are also subject to fluctuations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some frequently asked questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Is compound interest always worthwhile?</strong> It accelerates capital
      growth, but you need to evaluate whether the financial product you choose has a risk
      appropriate to your profile.</li>
      <li><strong>Should I reinvest the returns?</strong> To take advantage of the
      compounding effect, yes. Withdrawing the interest reduces the capitalization and slows
      exponential growth.</li>
      <li><strong>How do I choose the interest rate?</strong> Research the return on similar
      investments in the market and use conservative values when planning.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Understanding compound interest is fundamental for planning your future. Use this
      calculator and guide to explore scenarios, adjust goals and make informed decisions. If
      you want to delve even deeper, see the Portuguese and German versions of this guide.
