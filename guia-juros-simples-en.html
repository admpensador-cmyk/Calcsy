    <h1>Complete guide to simple interest</h1>
    <p>
      Simple interest is one of the basic concepts of financial mathematics. Unlike compound
      interest, where earnings are added to the principal and earn interest again, with simple
      interest the calculation is always based on the initial principal. This means the
      interest grows proportionally (linearly) with time.
    </p>
    <h2>Concept and formulas</h2>
    <p>
      The general formula for simple interest is \(J = C \times i \times n\), where \(J\) is
      the interest, \(C\) is the capital (initial amount), \(i\) is the rate per period
      (expressed as a decimal) and \(n\) is the number of periods. The final amount is given
      by \(M = C + J\). In other words, you calculate the interest on the principal and add
      this value to obtain the total amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because interest is always calculated on the initial capital, the value increases
      linearly. For example, if you invest $1,000 at a rate of 2 % per month for 12 months,
      the interest will be $240 (since 0.02 × 1000 × 12), and the final amount will be $1,240.
      Notice that the interest increases at a constant rate without the “interest on
      interest” effect.
    </p>
    <h2>When to use simple interest</h2>
    <p>
      Simple interest is used in specific situations, such as certain commercial loans,
      simple discounts and educational calculations. In investments and financing,
      compound interest is much more common; therefore, use the simple interest calculator
      mainly for comparison or to learn the concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to remember that the rate and time must be in the same period. If the
      rate is monthly, the time must be given in months; if the rate is annual, the time
      must be in years. This ensures the calculation is consistent.
    </p>
    <h2>Practical example</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine you lend $5,000 at a rate of 1.5 % per month for 6 months. Using the formula
      \(J = C \times i \times n\), we get \(J = 5000 × 0.015 × 6 =\) $450. The final amount
      will be \(M = 5000 + 450 = 5450\). The total interest increased at a constant rate each
      month.
    </p>
    <p>
      This example shows how simple interest is predictable and easy to calculate. However,
      for long‑term applications or investments where earnings are reinvested, compound
      interest gives more realistic results. Understanding the differences helps you choose
      the right tool for each situation.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips and frequently asked questions</h2>
    <p>
      Below are some tips and answers to common questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Can I use simple interest to compare investments?</strong> Yes, but
      remember that most investments use compound interest; use simple calculations only for
      initial estimates.</li>
      <li><strong>How do I set the rate?</strong> By converting the percentage rate into its
      decimal form. For example, 2.5 % becomes 0.025.</li>
      <li><strong>Does simple interest always grow at the same rate?</strong> Yes, because it
      is calculated only on the initial principal.</li>
    </ul>
